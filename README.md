### Hi there, I'm Leandro Rebelo 👋

I’m a Software Engineer that likes to work with Software Architecture and Distributed Systems. I started in the I.T area in 2012. I like Open Source initiatives and I participate in the many meetups from the Open Source Community in my region. I like to make a bridge between the Customers and the Development team, and explain complex technical issues to clients and business issues to developers.

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently work at [Serasa](https://www.serasa.com.br/) as Technology Specialist.
